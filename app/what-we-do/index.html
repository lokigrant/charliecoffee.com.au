        <p>At Charlie Coffee, our philosophy is flavour. We believe coffee is an experience. We enjoy a second and even third cup and we believe your customers should too.</p>
        <p>We&#8217;ve created a blend that understands where the market is now, but also where it&#8217;s heading. We understand that people look for strength whilst being evermore demanding of flavour.</p>
        <p>We are part of a wave of coffee innovation that&#8217;s looking increasingly to the characteristics of the beans themselves brought out in the lighter roasts exploding into Australia&#8217;s cosmopolitan hubs.</p>

        <div class="su-heading su-heading-style-default su-heading-align-left" style="font-size:35px;margin-bottom:20px"><div class="su-heading-inner">The SERVICE</div></div>
        <p>Relationships are everything. We understand this. That&#8217;s why we focus on customer service. We are on this journey together and we bring with us not just a passion for coffee, we bring backgrounds in finance, business and sales and marketing.</p>
        <p>If there is a way we can help you or your business, we will. We&#8217;re smart enough to know that your success is our success.</p>

        <div class="su-heading su-heading-style-default su-heading-align-left" style="font-size:35px;margin-bottom:20px"><div class="su-heading-inner">The COMMUNITY</div></div>
        <p>Relationships are strengthened by community. A machine is made of many parts and we believe success is the same.</p>
        <p>That&#8217;s why here at Charlie Coffee we offer you a community. We offer you a network of connections and ideas gathered from our various endeavours.</p>
        <p>Our partnership doesn&#8217;t have to stop at the provision of beans and unbeatable service. Let us help you to that next stage of growth. Whether it&#8217;s an introduction to a somebody or a service that can help your business, or, a mutually beneficial partnership. Let&#8217;s get out the old chalkboard and talk.</p>
